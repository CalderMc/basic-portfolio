<p>I am from North Carolina. I work full-time and typically juggle numerous tasks despite the difficulty.</p>

<p>Two years ago, my wife and I planned our wedding and houseshopped while we were both taking masters level courses in college.</p>

<p>We closed on our house two weeks before our wedding. I moved in that day.</p>

<p>We worked on finals projects on our wedding night and managed to submit them just before the midnight deadline.</p>

<p>After a few days in Park City, we moved her into our home and began the process of selling her previous home.</p>

<p>After those few months, I knew that I could tackle any task with her help... so although I have started slowly, I welcome this challenge!</p>
